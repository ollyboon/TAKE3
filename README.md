# Holton Lee App - Studio 119

Within these files that have been submitted are a compressed version of our App, a portfolio of our progress throughout the project with references to significant parts of the journey and a video walk through simulation of the app itself.

- The xCode project code is commented to identify what each chunk of code represents within the app.
- The portfolio contains our journey through the project including visits to Holton Lee, the applications used along the way to make the app, the group dynamics and materials used within the app (graphs, mockups etc.)
- The video walk through is a simulation of the routes within the Holton Lee grounds and demonstrates a user following these routes, showing the various pop up cards along the way. The video also shows the other functions within the app.
